## Core Idea

Sell services to players and groups:

- Construction of systems, bases, or defenses.  
- Protection, escort, or sabotage/assassination.
- Flexible – will expand as opportunities appear.

---

## Goals

- Expand presence to every major colony with at least one **hidden or public office**.
- Maintain an aura of professionalism and secrecy.
- Build a reputation so players seek us out for solutions.

## Notes / RP Hooks

- **Branding:** Decide on company colors, name, and insignia.    
- **Contracts:** Written books or maps can serve as formal contracts.
- **Rank System:** Possible “customer levels” to incentivize loyalty.
- **Mystery:** Not everyone has to know the full roster – can roleplay as an organization bigger than it really is.
